# Research: All "rlm-secure" Project Name References

**Date**: 2026-02-14T01:44:59+00:00
**Researcher**: claude
**Git Commit**: f320a3ad1efae825cf953cea2c8448330215d278
**Branch**: main
**Repository**: rlm-nix-wasm

## Research Question
Find everywhere the "rlm-secure" project name is used in order to rename it.

## Summary

The name `rlm-secure` appears in **18 files** across the codebase. The occurrences fall into 5 categories: (1) build/packaging config, (2) source code, (3) documentation, (4) project metadata/settings, and (5) historical plans/research/handoffs. Two case variants exist: `rlm-secure` (kebab-case, dominant) and `RLM-Secure` (title-case, once in PLAN.md). The underscore variant `rlm_secure` is **not used** anywhere.

## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: Build & Packaging (MUST change)

These define the installable package name and must be updated for the rename to work.

| File | Line | Context |
|------|------|---------|
| `pyproject.toml:2` | `name = "rlm-secure"` | Python package name — **primary source of truth** |
| `uv.lock:1593` | `name = "rlm-secure"` | Lock file — will be regenerated by `uv lock` after pyproject.toml change |

### Category 2: Source Code (MUST change)

Functional code referencing the project name.

| File | Line | Context |
|------|------|---------|
| `src/rlm/types.py:100` | `cache_dir: Path = Path.home() / ".cache" / "rlm-secure"` | Default cache directory path — affects where user data is stored on disk |
| `src/rlm/cli.py:1` | `"""CLI entry point for rlm-secure."""` | Module docstring |

### Category 3: Documentation (SHOULD change)

User-facing docs that reference the project name in prose.

| File | Lines | Occurrence count |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `README.md` | 1, 5, 19, 39 | 4 occurrences |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 7 | 1 occurrence |
| `docs/tutorial.md` | 1, 3 (×2), 10, 28, 61, 65, 117, 130 | 10 occurrences |
| `docs/reference.md` | 3, 38, 62, 220 | 4 occurrences |
| `docs/explanation.md` | 3, 21, 59, 63, 65, 67, 71 | 7 occurrences |
| `docs/how-to-guides.md` | 3, 124, 140, 214 | 4 occurrences |
| `docs/plans/2026-02-09-timing-instrumentation.md` | 5 | 1 occurrence |

### Category 4: Project Metadata & Settings (SHOULD change)

| File | Line | Context |
|------|------|---------|
| `.claude/settings.json:13` | `"CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID": "rlm-secure"` | Claude Code task list ID |
| `PLAN.md` | 1, 84, 271, 321, 1412, 1418, 1438 | 7 occurrences (implementation plan document) |

### Category 5: Historical Research & Plans (OPTIONAL)

These are historical documents in `thoughts/` — they reflect the project name at the time of writing. Updating is optional since they serve as historical records.

| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `thoughts/shared/research/2026-02-10-trace-flag-file-storage.md` | 6, 20, 27, 128, 160, 173 |
| `thoughts/shared/research/2026-02-09-dual-model-orchestrator-child.md` | 6, 20 |
| `thoughts/shared/research/2026-02-09-trace-event-ordering.md` | 6, 20 |
| `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-02-10-wasm-eval-operation.md` | 127 |
| `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-02-09-dual-model-orchestrator-child.md` | 70, 523 |
| `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2026-02-09_18-22-48_timing-instrumentation.md` | 6 |

### Case Variants Found

| Variant | Location |
|---------|----------|
| `rlm-secure` | All files above (kebab-case, dominant) |
| `RLM-Secure` | `PLAN.md:1` — "# RLM-Secure Implementation Plan" |
| `rlm_secure` | **Not used anywhere** |
| `RlmSecure` | **Not used anywhere** |

### Git Remote

The GitHub remote URL also contains the project name:
```
origin  git@github.com:winklerj/rlm-secure.git
```
This would need a GitHub repository rename (separate from code changes).

## Rename Checklist

### Critical (breaks functionality if missed)
1. `pyproject.toml:2` — package name
2. `src/rlm/types.py:100` — default cache directory path
3. `uv.lock:1593` — regenerate with `uv lock` after pyproject.toml change
4. GitHub repository name — rename via GitHub settings

### Important (user-facing references)
5. `README.md` — 4 occurrences
6. `CLAUDE.md` — 1 occurrence
7. `src/rlm/cli.py:1` — docstring
8. `docs/tutorial.md` — 10 occurrences
9. `docs/reference.md` — 4 occurrences
10. `docs/explanation.md` — 7 occurrences
11. `docs/how-to-guides.md` — 4 occurrences
12. `docs/plans/2026-02-09-timing-instrumentation.md` — 1 occurrence
13. `PLAN.md` — 7 occurrences
14. `.claude/settings.json` — task list ID

### Optional (historical documents)
15. `thoughts/shared/research/` — 3 files
16. `thoughts/shared/plans/` — 2 files
17. `thoughts/shared/handoffs/` — 1 file

### Note on `src/rlm/` directory
The Python package directory is `src/rlm/` (not `src/rlm_secure/`). If the new name also uses `rlm` as the importable package, no directory rename is needed. If the import name changes, the entire `src/rlm/` directory would need renaming along with all internal imports.

## Open Questions
- What is the new project name?
- Should the Python import name (`rlm`) also change, or just the project/package name?
- Should the CLI command name (`rlm`) change?
- Should the default cache directory change for existing users (migration concern)?
- Should historical documents in `thoughts/` be updated?
